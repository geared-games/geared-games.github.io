hi its me pyromania and this is a small website i made (and will continue to update).
i hope to find more ways to implement more unique games 
if there is something im working on ill put it here and in the github issues tab

WHAT IS HE WORKING ON THATS TAKING SO LONG:

sorry for less frequent updates recently i took a break for a while and then on top of that i am currently working on adding dsiware games.

the problem is i need a bios file for that wich i plan on getting from personal dsi but im not sure how to add that to the melonds core in emulator js.

if you have any tips let me know :P.
